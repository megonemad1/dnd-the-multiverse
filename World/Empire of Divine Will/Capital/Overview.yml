      or desire the hearts of men;

    history: >
      a sprawling metropolis, a city large and inflated with gold and ambission.
      capital owes its sucess in part to its location, as well as being a center for trade
      toughout the ages. the city has a number of other benifits that have served it well
      though the ages and secured its presance in history, such as the natral defence granted 
      to it by its island nature the entire Gold river estry to wide to fire projectiles proved 
      an unbeatable defece against mundane attack. 
      capitals sucsess has drawn alot of talented people and artizans and masters of their trade
      these master proved most usefull in the many battles capital as been the backdrop for.
      in the battle of arken it is said every solder from lowly squire the the most formidable
      black hawk knight weilded master work weppons each embuned with the power of Kord, and bound to
      its weilder so these potant weppons could never be used against capital.

      magic has always played a part in the history of capital, but its crouning achevement was back in 
      its 3ed erea, at this time the world was in chaos due to the new inivation of teleportation circles
      and diementional gates, this termoil caued the destuction of many civilissations like capitan some on
      which capital was built. it was at this time a sorcerer, at the mages guild deviced a spell that not only
      was far simpler than any teleportation spell used at the time but also simple to teach new initiates 
      and whats more this spell ritual was capable of blocking teleportation into a large area around the 
      casted site and for a long time without conserntration. 
      with the threat of teleportation based supprise attack capital was able to foucus on expanding borders and
      inovating in multitudes of other areas. it was not until the 4th age that the spell left capital. it is now
      a staple and the required learning of most mage guild members and non members alike.

      with the invention of trans-diementional and teleportative magical blocks and the assasination of the leader of
      capital that a new erea of stability was reached, the new threat for capital was internal as such it held its
      expansion to deal with its bubbling sespool of internal politics, an arcaic law set that had grown oppressive
      with the new leader of temeal a shepard whom had worked his way up until he stood at the top of capital as its leader.
      temeal created many enermys, but though the sweeping changes before his assasination was able to solidify 
      capitals socity on a path which would lead it to dominate trade routes all over the contanent and beond.

      capital has for a long time been growing, its biggest setback however was in the 7th age
      it was during this age when the many mages and magical scollers had been shown undeniable everdance 
      that it was their hand in socity that was the cause for the cration of the worlds most deadlest weppons
      or worse, this caused a feud between users of the arcne arts, a large goup wanted to destroy magic entierly
      stating "the world would know peace without magic" whilst another faction sort to bring magic to the masses 
      and among other contibutions began massproducing magical artifacts of vairying potancy, their idea was
      that "if every one has magic then they could stop any ill minded thret" meanwhile more splinter cells with a wide
      range of ideals forght in the gaps.
      it was the forging of the 8th age that saw the city  of learning built and contibuted to by all major powers
      on the contanant. it was designed to be a haven for magic scollers whom could devote themselves to their reasearch
      and the city would handle the ethics and polecing as well as the control of magical exports from
      the city. the city would be entierly self suficant and was selective about who can enter, this was in attempt
      to protect the magical secrets they where charged with garding.
